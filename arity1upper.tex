\label{sec:unary}

In this section we will argue that unary systems at arity $1$ and delay $2$ and $3$, respectively, cannot fold infinite transcripts deterministically. As we will see, in fact, the length of transcripts deterministically foldable by these systems has an upper bound quadratic in the length $n$ of the seed. The main result is the following theorem, which is a direct consequence of Lemmas~\ref{lem:d2a1}  and \ref{lem:d3a1} which follow.
\begin{theorem}[$\delta\in\{ 2,3\}, \alpha = 1$]\label{thm:d23a1}
	The terminal conformation of a deterministic unary oritatami system at arity $\alpha = 1$ and delay $\delta \in \{2,3\}$ is of length at most $3n^2+4n+2$.
\end{theorem}

Let us fix some common starting points for Lemmas~\ref{lem:d2a1} and \ref{lem:d3a1}. Let the point where the first transcript bead was fixed be $p$. We will argue about the situation when the first bead is stabilized outside $\hexagon_p^n$ (a hexagon of radius $n$). Let this be the $i$th bead of the transcript. Without loss of generality, we can translate the origin $(0,0)$ to the coordinates of bead $i-1$ (which is still in $\hexagon_p^n$), and we can assume that bead $i$ is fixed at $(1,1)$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:hexagonOut}).

%\subsubsection{\ref{sec:unary}.1 \ \ $\delta = 2$\\}
\begin{lemma}[$\delta=2, \alpha =1$]\label{lem:d2a1}
	The terminal conformation of a deterministic unary oritatami system of $\delta=2$ and $\alpha = 1$ is of length at most $3n^2+4n+2$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
In the elongation that places bead $i$ at $(1,1)$ there are two possibilities. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $i$ forms a bond with a bead at $(1,0)$.
	\item  $i$ does not bond to anything and $i+1$ is at $(2,1)$ bonding with a bead at $(2,0)$. If there is no bead at $(1,0)$, then placing $i$ at $(1,0)$ instead of $(1,1)$ results in the same number of bonds, leading to nondeterminism. Therefore, there has to be a bead at $(1,0)$ and it is inactive, otherwise it would bond to $i$. This is analogous to case 1. below, with the only difference being that the bond between (1,1) and (1,0) is missing.%as in Fig.~\ref{fig:hexagonOut1}.
\end{itemize}

	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.2\linewidth]{./Fig/hexagonOut1}
		%\caption{}
		\label{fig:hexagonOut1}
	\end{figure}
 
%The only position with which $(1,1)$ can form a bond is $(1,0)$. This means that there is a bead at $(1,0)$, which bonds to bead $i$, otherwise there are other conformations in which beads $i$ and $i+1$ add one bond to the conformation, making the behavior nondeterministic.
Because of the above, we need only consider the case when $i$ binds to a bead at (1,0). The next bead, $i+1$, can be fixed at $(2,1)$ or at $(0,1)$ as all other possibilities result in nondeterministic behavior immediately, so we have two cases.

%\begin{enumerate}
\noindent\textbf{Case 1.} bead $i+1$ is fixed at $(2,1)$ and can bond with a bead at $(2,0)$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:hexagonOut2}). Now consider bead $i+2$. For $i+1$ to be fixed at $(2,1)$, $i+2$ needs to form a bond somewhere, otherwise $i+2$ could go to $(2,1)$ forming the bond with the bead at $(2,0)$ and there would be two conformations with the maximal $1$ bond. The only possibility is that there is a bead at $(3,0)$ and $i+2$ can bond with it when placed at $(3,1)$. We can apply the same argument inductively: there is some $m\geq 0$ such that grid points $(\ell,0)$ are occupied by beads with free hands, for all $\ell\in \{2,\dots,2+m\}$, and there is no bead at $(3+m,0)$. Such an $m$ exists, and it is not greater than $n$, because those beads are all stabilized along the same side of $\hexagon_p^n$. Then, bead $i+\ell$ is fixed at $(\ell+1,1)$ and bonds with $(\ell+1,0)$. However, bead $i+2+m$ cannot be fixed anywhere, because $i+2+m$ and $i+3+m$ can only add one bond to the conformation, and that is possible either with $i+2+m \rightarrow (2+m,1)$, $i+3+m \rightarrow (3+m,1)$ or with $i+2+m \rightarrow (2+m,2)$, $i+3+m \rightarrow (2+m,1)$. Intuitively, when we reach a corner of the hexagon $\hexagon_p^n$, the next bead of the transcript cannot deterministically stabilize, as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:hexagonOut2}. In this case, the size of the transcript which was deterministically stabilized is bounded by the size of $\hexagon_p^n$ plus the length of one side of $\hexagon_p^{n+1}$, so by $(3n^2+3n+1)+(n+1)=3n^2+4n+2$.

		\caption{When bead $i+2+m$ is fixed}
		\label{fig:hexagonOut2}
	\end{figure}

\vspace{0.2cm}
	
\noindent\textbf{Case 2.} bead $i+1$ is fixed at $(0,1)$. This is only possible if\\
\textbf{(a)} there is an inactive bead at $(-1,0)$ and one with a free hand one at $(-2,0)$. This case is symmetrical to (1).
there is no bead at $(-1,0)$, bead $i+1$ can bond with bead $i-1$ at $(0,0)$ and the bead $i+2$ can be placed at $(-1,0)$ where it can bond with $(-2,0)$, $(-2,-1)$ or $(-1,-1)$. This leads to nondeterminism, because placing bead $i$ at $(-1,0)$ and bead $i+1$ at $(0,1)$ would yield two bonds, just as the original conformation.\\
\textbf{(b)	} there is a bead at $(-1,0)$ and bead $i+1$ can bond with that or with bead $i-1$ at $(0,0)$. However, this means that placing bead $i$ at $(0,1)$ at bead $i+1$ at $(1,1)$ creates the same number of hydrogen bonds, thus resulting in bead $i$ not being placed deterministically.

Case 2.(a) gives the same upper bound as case 1. Cases 2.(b)-(c) give the smaller upper bound $|\hexagon_p^n|+1$, thereby concluding the proof.

%\subsubsection{\ref{sec:unary}.2 \ \ $\delta = 3$\\}

\begin{lemma}[$\delta=3, \alpha =1$]\label{lem:d3a1}
	The terminal conformation of a deterministic unary oritatami system of $\delta=3$ and $\alpha = 1$ is of length at most $3n^2+4n+2$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We will argue similarly to the $\delta=2$ case: when we stabilize beads outside $\hexagon_p^n$, we can only do so at points right next to one of the sides and even there only until we reach a corner. This yields the upper bound immediately.

As before, let us assume that the last bead stabilized within $\hexagon_p^n$ is at point $(0,0)$ and the next bead is the first to be stabilized outside $\hexagon_p^n$ at point $(1,1)$. Depending on whether bead $i-1$ at point (0,0) has a free hand to form a bond or not, we distinguish two cases.\\
%\begin{enumerate}
\noindent\textbf{Case 1.}  Bead $i-1$ at (0,0) has a free hand. If the most stable conformation formed by beads $i, i+1, i+2$ adds only two  bonds, it will be nondeterministic because there are at least two possibilities (see Fig.~\ref{fig:beadi2}, except it starts from (0,0) not (1,1)). Therefore, it needs to make three new bonds to deterministically stabilize $i$. There are five possible cases in which beads $i, i+1, i+2$ can add three bonds, see Fig.~\ref{fig:3bonds}. In the cases (b) and (e) in Fig.~\ref{fig:3bonds}, there are beads having a free hand at (1,0) and (-1,0) already stabilized before bead $i-1$ is fixed at (0,0). One of these two beads may be a predecessor of bead $i-1$, but at least one of them is not. When bead $i-1$ is fixed at (0,0), it makes a bond with the one of these two beads which is not its predecessor. This means that it is impossible to have three beads at (-1,0), (0,0) and (1,0), each with a free hand, when bead $i$ is fixed, and consequently, cases (b) and (e) in Fig.~\ref{fig:3bonds} cannot occur. Case (d) in Fig.~\ref{fig:3bonds} becomes nondeterministic when bead $i$ is fixed because bead $i$ can be fixed at (-1,0) and bond with (-2,0), bead $i+1$ can be placed (0,1) and bond with (0,0) and bead $i+2$ can be placed (1,1) and bond with (0,1). If it makes three bonds once, such as (a) and (c) in Fig.~\ref{fig:3bonds}, it will need to make three bonds forever to be deterministic. Similarly to case 1. in the previous section, cases (a) and (c) in Fig.~\ref{fig:3bonds} lead to nondeterministism eventually, when the transcript reaches a first corner of $\hexagon_p^n$.

\noindent\textbf{Case 2.} Bead $i-1$ at (0,0) does not have a free hand.\\
(i) First, let us assume that there is a bead at (1,0) which has a free hand. If there is a bead at (1,0) and beads $i, i+1, i+2$ add only two bonds, we instantly get nondeterministism as in Fig.~\ref{fig:beadat(1,0)}. Hence, beads $i, i+1, i+2$ need to make three bonds to stabilize $i$, but if they make three hydrogen bonds, the situation is analogous to (a) and (c) in Fig.~\ref{fig:3bonds}. 

%There are not any bead having a free hand at (1,0) or (-1,0) to prevent from being (a) and (c) in Fig.~\ref{fig:3bonds}. 
\noindent (ii) Now consider when there is no bead at (1,0) or there is one, but with no free hand. Let us discuss the moment after bead $i$ is fixed outside $\hexagon_p^n$. Now bead $i$ has a free hand because it cannot bind to (1,0). If beads $i+1, i+2, i+3$ can form only two bonds, it will be nondeterministic because there are at least two possible such conformations, as in Fig.~\ref{fig:beadi2}. Hence, they need to form three bonds to deterministically stabilize, such as in Fig.~\ref{fig:3bonds2}. Case (a) in Fig.~\ref{fig:3bonds2}. becomes the same as case (a) in Fig.~\ref{fig:3bonds}. Case (b) in Fig.~\ref{fig:3bonds2} becomes nondeterministic already when bead $i$ is fixed because bead $i$ could also be fixed at (1,0).\\

We have shown that at $\alpha=1$ and  $\delta\in\{2,3\}$, unary oritatami systems can only fold finite length transcripts deterministically, and the length of that transcript is bounded by the size of the regular hexagon of radius $n$ plus the length of one side of the surrounding hexagon. This gives us the upper bound $|\hexagon_p^{n}|+(n+1)=3n^2+4n+2$,  where $n$ is the length of the seed, concluding the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:d23a1}.
