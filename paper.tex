\begin{abstract}
We investigate simple oritatami systems in an attempt to establish lower bounds on the size and complexity of computationally universal systems. 
In particular, we look at oritatami systems, where the folding sequence consists of a number of beads of the same type and show that under reasonable assumptions, these systems are not universal.

	\section{Introduction}
%------------------------------------------------------

Transcription is the first essential step of gene expression, when a DNA template sequence is copied into a complementary single stranded RNA sequence by a `copy machine' called RNA polymerase. 
The RNA strand is synthesized letter by letter according to the complimentarity relation ${\tt A} \rightarrow {\tt U}$, ${\tt G} \rightarrow {\tt C}$, ${\tt C} \rightarrow {\tt G}$, and ${\tt T} \rightarrow {\tt A}$ and folds up during a process called co-transcriptional folding.

In a recent breakthrough in molecular engineering by Geary, Rothemund and Andersen~\cite{GearyRothemundAndersen2014} the co-transcriptional folding of RNA is controlled by careful design of the DNA template. As demonstrated in laboratory, this method, called RNA Origami, makes it possible to build rectangles out of RNA strands. 
Geary et al.~\cite{GeMeScSe2016} proposed a mathematical model for this process, called oritatami system.
It has been just shown in \cite{GeMeScSe2018} that the model is efficiently Turing universal by simulating cyclic tag systems introduced by Cook~\cite{Cook2004}. 
The simulation involves a very large and complex oritatami system. 
One future direction of research is to find smaller universal oritatami system.

Closely related is the question of where not to look for universal systems, i.e., what are the limitations of simple oritatami system. 
In search for simple oritatami systems, there are a number of restrictions one can pose on them:
\begin{itemize}
\item bounds on the delay, the number of bead types or the arity;
\item bounds on the size of the primary structure or of the attraction rule set;
\item structural conditions on the primary structure or the attraction rule set.
\end{itemize}

%Rogers and Seki~\cite{SimpleSim} showed that certain OS with small delays are not universal.

%Han, Kim, Rogers and Seki\cite{SelfRemove} proved that it is possible to avoid self-attraction rules without changing the behavior of OS.

In this paper we start a new line of study which concerns the alphabet size for the primary structure, i.e., the number of bead types.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:check_validity}
	For any rule set $R$, arity $\alpha$ and conformation $C = (P,w,H)$ it is possible to check whether $C$ is $R$-valid and whether $C\in \mathcal{C}_{\leq \alpha}$ in time $\mathcal{O}(|H|\cdot|w|\cdot|R|)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	To check whether $C$ is $R$-valid:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item FOR each $(i,j)\in H$:
		\item \hspace{1cm} IF $(w[i],w[j])\notin R$ THEN answer NO and HALT
		\item answer YES and HALT
	\end{enumerate}	
	Checking the condition in 2. can be done in $\mathcal{O}(|w|\cdot|R|)$ time for any reasonable representation of $w$ and $R$, hence the whole process takes $\mathcal{O}(|H|\cdot |w|\cdot|R|)$ time.	
	To check the arity constraint $C\in \mathcal{C}_{\leq \alpha}$: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item FOR each $i\in \{1,\dots,|w|\}$:
		\item \hspace{1cm} IF $\mathrm{degree}(i)=|\{j | (i,j)\in H \}|>\alpha$ THEN answer NO and HALT
		\item answer YES and HALT
	\end{enumerate}	
	Checking the condition in 2. can be done in $\mathcal{O}(|H|)$ time for any reasonable representation of $H$, hence the whole process takes $\mathcal{O}(|w|\cdot|H|)$ time.
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:OS_to_2dTM}
	There is an algorithm that simulates any oritatami system $\Xi = (\Sigma, R, \delta, \alpha, \sigma, w)$ in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(\delta)}\cdot |R|\cdot|w|$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Take any step in the computation, up to which some $i \ge 0$ first beads of $w$ have been stabilized, with the last bead at a point $p$. 
	The number of all possible elongations of the current conformation by the next $\delta$-beads is $(6 \times 5^{\delta-1}) \times ((2^4)^{\delta-1} \times 2^5) \in 2^{O(\delta)}$. 
	By Proposition~\ref{prop:check_validity}, we can check for each of these elongations whether its arity is at most $\alpha$ or not and whether it is $R$-valid or not in time $\mathcal{O}((2^4)^{\delta-1}\cdot2^5\cdot \delta\cdot|R|)=2^{\mathcal{O}(\delta)}\cdot|R|$.  Therefore, the total running time is $2^{\mathcal{O}(\delta)}\cdot |R|\cdot|w|$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	For fixed $\delta$ and $\alpha$, the class of problems solvable by oritatami systems $(\Sigma, R, \delta, \alpha, \sigma, w)$ is included in $\mathrm{DTIME}(n^3)$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	The claim follows from Theorem~\ref{thm:OS_to_2dTM} and the fact that $|R|$ is implicitly bounded by $|w|^2$.
\end{proof}

%\begin{corollary}\label{polytranscript}
%	Let $k$ be a non-negative number. Let $\Sigma$, $H$, $\delta$, $\alpha$ be fixed and the transcript length bounded polynomially by the seed length, i.e., $|w|\in O(|\sigma|^k)$. Then, the language of seeds $\sigma$ accepted by an OS $(\Sigma, R, \delta, \alpha, \sigma, w)$ is in $\mathrm{DTIME}(|\sigma|^{2k})$.
%\end{corollary}

%If the transcript length is polynomially bounded by the seed length, than the accepted language is in $\mathrm{P}$. 

Because of the time hierarchy theorems, we know that $\mathrm{P}\subsetneq \mathrm{EXP}$, so we can conclude that OS which cannot deterministically fold transcripts of length exponential in the length of the seed are not computationally universal.

	\section{Problem description}
%-------------------------------------------------------

In \cite{DHOPRSST2018}, Demaine et al. proved that at delay 1 and arity 1, an oritatami system can fold upon the seed of size $n$ only the first $9n$ beads of a transcript deterministically. 
We consider this finiteness problem for unary oritatami systems under various settings of the values of delay and arity, which is formalized as follows. 

\begin{problem}\label{prob:det_unary_length}
Give an upper bound on the length of a transcript of a delay-$\delta$, arity-$\alpha$ deterministic unary oritatami system whose seed is of length $n$ by a function in $\delta$, $\alpha$, and $n$. 
\end{problem}



Results on this problem are summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:summary}.
