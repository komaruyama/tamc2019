In this section, we consider Problem~\ref{prob:det_unary_length} at delay 1. Our result, cases of arity 1 and 3 can only yield finite structures of size $O (n)$, and cases of arity 4 and more can only yield finite structures which is size of $O (n^2)$, and a case of arity 2 can yield infinite structures but they are only the zig-zag conformation shown in Fig.~\ref{TTT_zigzag}. 

%In this section, we prove that unary oritatami system can form infinitely at delay 1 and arity 2 deterministically and moreover that the only infinite conformations which its oritatami system can yield is only the zig-zag conformation shown in Fig.\ref{TTT_zigzag}. 


Let $\Xi = (\Sigma, R, \delta, \alpha, \sigma, w)$ be a deterministic oritatami system of delay 1. 
For $i \geq 0$ let $C_i$ be the unique elongation of $\sigma$ by $w[1..i]$, that is, foldable by $\Xi$. Hence $C_0 = \sigma$.

At delay 1, a bead cannot collaborate with its successors in order to stabilize itself. 
In fact, there are just two ways for a bead to get stabilized at delay 1 (or the bead has no place to be stabilized around so that the system halts), as observed in \cite{DHOPRSST2018}. 
One is to be bound to another bead and the other is through a 1-in-1-out structure called the tunnel section. 
See Fig.~\ref{fig:TTT_tunnel}. 
A \textit{tunnel section} consists of one free point $p_c$ and four beads that occupy four neighbors of $p_c$. 
In order for an oritatami system to stabilize the bead $w[i]$ at the central point $p_c$, its predecessor $w[i-1]$ must be put at one of the two free neighbors of $p$. 
Thus, at the stabilization of $w[i]$, only one neighbor of $p$ is left free so that the successor $w[i+1]$ is to be stabilized there, even without being bound. 
In this case, the point $p_e$ where $w[i-1]$ is stabilized is considered to be an \textit{entrance of the tunnel section} and the point $p_s$ where $w[i+1]$ is stabilized is considered as its \textit{exit}. 
A \textit{tunnel} is a maximal set of tunnel sections whose central points form a path. 

The behavior of an oritatami system at delay 1 can be described by a sequence of $S$ of $b$ (bound), $t_s$ (straight tunnel section), $t_o$ (obtuse-turn tunnel section), and $t_a$ (acute-turn tunnel section); priority is given to tunnel, that is, $S[i]$ is $t_s$ (resp.~$t_o$, $t_a$) if the $i$-th bead of the system is stabilized not only by being bonded but also through a straight (resp. obtuse-turn, acute-turn) tunnel section. 
Let us introduce $t$ as a wildcard for $t_s$, $t_o$, and $t_a$. 
We also let $S$ take the value $\blacksquare$ for halt (due to the lack of free neighbors). 

%If a bead is stabilized through a tunnel section, then it can provide some bonds. Let us consider bonds of $C_i$. $C_i$ is represented $C = (W,P,H)$ where $|W| = i + n$ $C_i$ contains $\alpha \cdot (i + n) - 2|H|$ bonds because $C_i$ consists of $i + n$ beads and a bead has just $\alpha$ bonds and then $2 |H|$ of the those bonds are already used. However, even if a bead has an available bond, $w[j]$ $(j > i)$ might not be able to use this bond because the bond has possibility that it is blocked by transcripts $w[i+1..j-1]$. Number of $binding\ capabilities$ does not contain that case so that it is at most $\alpha \cdot (i + n) - 2|H|$.

%We say that point $p$ is reachable from a conformation $C$ if there exists a directed path $P^\prime$ from the last point of $C$ that does not cross the path of $C$. 
We say that a neighbor of a point $p$ is reachable from a conformation $C$ if there exists an elongation of $C$ in which a bead occupies the neighbor and it binds with a bead at $p$. 
Taking this reachability into account, we define the \textit{binding capability} of a conformation as the number of free bonds of its beads available geometrically for elongations of $C$.
It is defined formally as follows: 

\begin{definition}[Binding Capability]
Let $\alpha$ be an arity and $C = (P,w,H)$ be a conformation of arity at most $\alpha$.
Let $H_k = H \cap \{ (i,j) \mid \mbox{$i=k$ or $j=k$} \}$. 
Moreover, let $R_k$ be a set of neighbors of the point $P[k]$ that are free and reachable from $C$.
The binding capability of $C$ at arity $\alpha$, denoted by $\#bc_\alpha(C)$, is defined by $\sum^{|w|}_{k=1} \min \{\alpha-|H_k|, |R_k|\}$.
The subscript $\alpha$ is omitted whenever it is clear from context. 
\end{definition}
%
Observe one almost-trivial but important fact that a bead inside a tunnel does not increase the binding capability. 
This is because for such a bead $w[k]$, $|R_k| = 0$. 

We now prove that in ``almost all'' tunnels is a troll domiciled and robs the transcript of binding capability (the original story is from \cite{Pratchett1992}). 
Originally, we tried to find a troll in every tunnel but failed; a troll seems to dislike the very first bead $w[1]$, or its property that only $\alpha$+1 beads around may take all hands of $w[1]$ thanks to the absence of its predecessor; any other bead must be surrounded by at least $\alpha+2$ beads in order to be free from free hand because a bead cannot bind with its predecessor or successor. 
We call a bead \textit{singular} if it is surrounded by only $\alpha+1$ beads but forms $\alpha$ bonds. 
Any bead but $w[1]$ can be singular because of their predecessor and successor. 
A tunnel is \textit{singular} if its entrance or exit is next to $w[1]$ that is singular. 
There can be at most 3 tunnels around one bead so that no more than 3 tunnels can be singular. 
A singular tunnel will be denoted with the superscript $\times$ like $t_s^\times$ or $t^\times$. 
In contrast, the notation without $\times$ such as $t_s$ and $t$ shall imply their non-singularity.
