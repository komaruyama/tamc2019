In this section, we consider Problem~\ref{prob:det_unary_length} at delay 1. Our result, cases of arity 1 and 3 can only yield finite structures of size $O (n)$, and cases of arity 4 and more can only yield finite structures which is size of $O (n^2)$, and a case of arity 2 can yield infinite structures but they are only the zig-zag conformation shown in Fig.~\ref{TTT_zigzag}. 

%In this section, we prove that unary oritatami system can form infinitely at delay 1 and arity 2 deterministically and moreover that the only infinite conformations which its oritatami system can yield is only the zig-zag conformation shown in Fig.\ref{TTT_zigzag}. 


Let $\Xi = (\Sigma, R, \delta, \alpha, \sigma, w)$ be a deterministic oritatami system of delay 1. 
For $i \geq 0$ let $C_i$ be the unique elongation of $\sigma$ by $w[1..i]$, that is, foldable by $\Xi$. Hence $C_0 = \sigma$.

At delay 1, a bead cannot collaborate with its successors in order to stabilize itself. 
In fact, there are just two ways for a bead to get stabilized at delay 1 (or the bead has no place to be stabilized around so that the system halts). 
One is to be bound and the other is through a 1-in-1-out structure called the tunnel section. 
See Fig.~\ref{fig:TTT_tunnel}. 
A \textit{tunnel section} consists of four beads that occupy four neighbors of one point. 

Let us consider the stabilization of the $i$-th bead $w[i]$ of the transcript $w$ upon $C_{i-1}$. 
The bead cannot collaborate with any succeeding bead $w[i+1],w[i+2],\cdots$ at delay 1. There are just two ways to get stabilized at delay 1. One way is to be bound to another bead. The other way is through a $tunnel\ section$. A tunnel section consists of four beads that occupy four neighbors of a point (Fig.\ref{TTT_tunnel_intro}). 
Accordingly, how they are stabilized can be described by a sequence $S$ of $b$'s (bound) and $t$'s (tunnel section); priority is given to $t$, that is, $S[i] = t$ if the $i$-th bead $w_i$ is stabilized not only by being bound but also through a tunnel section. 
We let $S$ take the value $\blacksquare$ for halt.

Assume that four of the six neighbors of a point $p$ are occupied by beads $a_{j_1},a_{j_2},a_{j_3},a_{j_4}$ while the other two are free. We call such a point $p$ the $inside\ of\ a\ tunnel$ and points $p^\prime$ the $entrance\ of\ a\ tunnel$ except when $p^\prime$ is inside of a tunnel. If the beads $w[i-2]$ and $w[i-1]$ are stabilized respectively at one of the two free neighbors and at $p$ one after another, then the next bead $w[i]$ cannot help but be stabilized at the other free neighbor. In this way, $w[i]$ can get stabilized without being bound.

%If a bead is stabilized through a tunnel section, then it can provide some bonds. Let us consider bonds of $C_i$. $C_i$ is represented $C = (W,P,H)$ where $|W| = i + n$ $C_i$ contains $\alpha \cdot (i + n) - 2|H|$ bonds because $C_i$ consists of $i + n$ beads and a bead has just $\alpha$ bonds and then $2 |H|$ of the those bonds are already used. However, even if a bead has an available bond, $w[j]$ $(j > i)$ might not be able to use this bond because the bond has possibility that it is blocked by transcripts $w[i+1..j-1]$. Number of $binding\ capabilities$ does not contain that case so that it is at most $\alpha \cdot (i + n) - 2|H|$.

We say that point $p$ is reachable from a conformation $C$ if there exists a directed path $P^\prime$ from the last point of $C$ that does not cross the path of $C$. We define $binding\ capability$ with reachable.

\begin{definition}[binding capability]
Let $C = (P,w,H)$ be a conformation.
Let $B_k$ be $H \cap \{ (i,j) \mid \mbox{$i=k$ or $j=k$} \}$. Moreover, let $R_k$ be a set of neighbors of the point $P[k]$ that are free and reachable from $C$.
 The binding capability of $C$, denoted by $\#bc(C)$, is defined by $\sum^{|w|}_{k=1} \min \{ |B_k|, |R_k|  \}$.
\end{definition}
