In this section, we consider Problem~\ref{prob:det_unary_length} at delay 1. Our result, cases of arity 1 and 3 can only yield finite structures of size $O (n)$, and cases of arity 4 and more can only yield finite structures which is size of $O (n^2)$, and a case of arity 2 can yield infinite structures but they are only the zig-zag conformation shown in Fig.~\ref{TTT_zigzag}. 

%In this section, we prove that unary oritatami system can form infinitely at delay 1 and arity 2 deterministically and moreover that the only infinite conformations which its oritatami system can yield is only the zig-zag conformation shown in Fig.\ref{TTT_zigzag}. 


Let $\Xi = (\Sigma, R, \delta, \alpha, \sigma, w)$ be a deterministic oritatami system of delay 1. 
For $i \geq 0$ let $C_i$ be the unique elongation of $\sigma$ by $w[1..i]$, that is, foldable by $\Xi$. Hence $C_0 = \sigma$.

At delay 1, a bead cannot collaborate with its successors in order to stabilize itself. 
In fact, there are just two ways for a bead to get stabilized at delay 1 (or the bead has no place to be stabilized around so that the system halts), as observed in \cite{DHOPRSST2018}. 
One is to be bound and the other is through a 1-in-1-out structure called the tunnel section. 
See Fig.~\ref{fig:TTT_tunnel}. 
A \textit{tunnel section} consists of four beads that occupy four neighbors of one free point. 
In order for an oritatam system to stabilize the bead $w[i]$ at the central point $p$ of a tunnel section, its predecessor $w[i-1]$ must be put at one of the two free neighbors of $p$. 
Thus, at the stabilization of $w[i]$, only one neighbor of $p$ is left free so that the successor $w[i+1]$ is to be stabilized there, even without being bound. 
In this case, the point where $w[i-1]$ is stabilized is considered to be an \textit{entrance of the tunnel} and the point where $w[i+1]$ is stabilized is considered as an \textit{exit of the tunnel}. 

The behavior of an oritatami system at delay 1 can be described by a sequence of $S$ of $b$ (bound), $t_s$ (straight tunnel section), $t_o$ (obtuse-turn tunnel section), and $t_a$ (acute-turn tunnel section); priority is given to tunnel, that is, $S[i]$ is $t_s$ (resp.~$t_o$, $t_a$) if the $i$-th bead of the system is stabilized not only by being bonded but also through a straight (resp. obtuse-turn, acute-turn) tunnel section. 
We let $S$ take the value $\blacksquare$ for halt (due to the lack of free neighbors). 

%Assume that four of the six neighbors of a point $p$ are occupied by beads $a_{j_1},a_{j_2},a_{j_3},a_{j_4}$ while the other two are free. We call such a point $p$ the $inside\ of\ a\ tunnel$ and points $p^\prime$ the $entrance\ of\ a\ tunnel$ except when $p^\prime$ is inside of a tunnel. If the beads $w[i-2]$ and $w[i-1]$ are stabilized respectively at one of the two free neighbors and at $p$ one after another, then the next bead $w[i]$ cannot help but be stabilized at the other free neighbor. In this way, $w[i]$ can get stabilized without being bound.

%If a bead is stabilized through a tunnel section, then it can provide some bonds. Let us consider bonds of $C_i$. $C_i$ is represented $C = (W,P,H)$ where $|W| = i + n$ $C_i$ contains $\alpha \cdot (i + n) - 2|H|$ bonds because $C_i$ consists of $i + n$ beads and a bead has just $\alpha$ bonds and then $2 |H|$ of the those bonds are already used. However, even if a bead has an available bond, $w[j]$ $(j > i)$ might not be able to use this bond because the bond has possibility that it is blocked by transcripts $w[i+1..j-1]$. Number of $binding\ capabilities$ does not contain that case so that it is at most $\alpha \cdot (i + n) - 2|H|$.

%We say that point $p$ is reachable from a conformation $C$ if there exists a directed path $P^\prime$ from the last point of $C$ that does not cross the path of $C$. 
We say that a neighbor of a point $p$ is reachable from a conformation $C$ if there exists an elongation of $C$ in which a bead occupies the neighbor and it binds with a bead at $p$. 
Taking this reachability into account, we define the \textit{binding capability} of a conformation as the number of free bonds of its beads available geometrically for elongations of $C$.
It is defined formally as follows: 

\begin{definition}[Binding Capability]
Let $\alpha$ be an arity and $C = (P,w,H)$ be a conformation of arity at most $\alpha$.
Let $H_k = H \cap \{ (i,j) \mid \mbox{$i=k$ or $j=k$} \}$. 
Moreover, let $R_k$ be a set of neighbors of the point $P[k]$ that are free and reachable from $C$.
The binding capability of $C$ at arity $\alpha$, denoted by $\#bc_\alpha(C)$, is defined by $\sum^{|w|}_{k=1} \min \{\alpha-|H_k|, |R_k|\}$.
Whenever the arity is clear from context, we omit the subscript $\alpha$. 
\end{definition}
