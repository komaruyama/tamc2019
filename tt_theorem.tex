\begin{theorem}[Tunnel Troll Theorem]
Let $\Xi$ be a deterministic unary oritatami system of delay $\delta = 1$. The following statements hold.
\begin{enumerate}
\item At arity $\alpha \geq 3$, if $S[i] = t$ (i.e. the tunnel that stabilizes $w[i]$ is not singular) and $S[i+1] \neq \blacksquare$, then $\#bc(C_{i-1}) > \#bc(C_i)$.
\item At arity $\alpha = 2$, if $n$ is the number of $bt$ in $S[i..j]$ for some $i,j$ such that $S[i] = b$ and $i < j$, then $\#bc(C_{i-2}) - \#bc(C_{j}) \geq n$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{TTT_entrance_Tab}
Let $\Xi$ be a deterministic unary oritatami system at delay $\delta = 1$, arity $\alpha =2$. 
Assume $\Xi$ stabilizes the transcript until $w[i-1]$. If $S[i+1] = b$ and $S[i+2] \in \{ t_s, t_o \} $, then $\#bc(C_{i-1}) > \#bc(C_{i})$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}%[lemma \ref{TTT_entrance_Tab}]
See Fig.\ref{TTT_tunnel_direction}.
$S[i+2] \in \{ t_s, t_o \} $ means that $w[i+2]$ is stabilized by a tunnel section of type $S$ or $O$.
Thus,  its predecessor $w[i+1]$ must be inside the tunnel section, that is, $n_1$ and $n_2$ must be occupied.
Free bonds of $w[i]$, if any, cannot be used in future by another bead $w[j]$ because otherwise the part of transcript $w[i..j]$ and the bond between $w[i]$ and $w[j]$ would form a closed curve and the curve would cross the path of $C_{i-1}$ between $n_1$ and $n_2$, contradiction.
%Binding capabilities that $w[i]$ supplies are inactive according to Jordan curve theorem on $n_1$, $n_2$, and $w[i]$.
Therefore, if $w[i]$ forms a bond at its stabilization $\#bc(C_{i-1}) > \#bc(C_{i})$ holds.
We now prove that $w[i]$ must form a bond.


Suppose $w[i]$ ware stabilized without any bond, that is, by a tunnel.
For that the two points that are a neighbor of both $w[i-1]$ and $w[i]$ must be occupied already.
In addition, at least one of the neighbors of $w[i]$ must be free because $S[i+1] = b$.
Thus, only the case to be considered is Fig.~\ref{TTT_tunnel_direction} (middle) with $n_5$ being occupied (that is, $n_4$ is free).
In this case, before $w[i]$ is stabilized, at lest three neighbors of $n_2$ ware free and hence, a bead at $n_2$ was provided with one free bond and could form a bond with $w[i]$. \qed

\begin{lemma}
\label{TTT_exit}
Let $\Xi$ be a deterministic unary oritatami system of delay $\delta = 1$ and arity $\alpha =2$.
%Let $w[i]$ be a bead which is stabilized at the exit of a tunnel.
If $S[h..i+1] = bt^{(i-h)}b$ for some $h<i-1$ and $S[i] = t_s$ or $t_o$, then $\#bc(C_{i-2}) \geq \#bc(C_i)$, and hence, $\#bc(C_{h-1}) \geq \#bc(C_i)$.
If $h < i-1$, then the second inequality is strengthened as $\#bc(C_{h-1}) > \#bc(C_{i})$.
%if we assume $\#bc(C_{i-2}) - \#bc(C_{i-1}) = a$, then $\#bc(C_{i}) - \#bc(C_{i-1}) \leq a$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}%[Lemma~ \ref{TTT_exit}]
Since the binding capability never increases inside a tunnel, we just need to consider the exit of a tunnel.
See Fig.\ref{TTT_tunnel_exit}. 
At least one of points $n_1$ or $n_2$ must be free because otherwise $w[i]$ would be inside of a tunnel, that is, $S[i+1]$ would not be $b$.

%If $i - h > 1$ and $j$ is such that $h \leq j<i$, then $\#bc(C_{j-1}) \geq \#bc(C_{j})$ because all neighbors of $w[j]$ are occupied by beads forming the tunnel so that any $w[i+1..]$ cannot reach neighbors of $w[j]$. 
%Thus, inside this tunnel, binding capabilities never increased.


Let $a$ be the number of bonds $w[i-1]$ forms, that is, $\#bc(C_{i-2}) - \#bc(C_{i-1}) = a$. Then, $\#bc(C_{i}) - \#bc(C_{i-1}) \leq a$ as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item{Case of both $n_1$ and $n_2$ being free}\\
  This case can be regarded the same as entrance. See Fig.\ref{TTT_tunnel_exit} (Left). Predecessor $n_5$ has to be bound to $n_4$ and $n_5$ because both of $n_3$ and $n_4$ have binding capabilities. Hence, $a \geq 2$. This time, $\alpha = 2$, that is, this case $\#bc(C_{i}) - \#bc(C_{i-1}) \leq a$.
  
\item{Case of $n_1$ is occupied}\\
  See Fig.\ref{TTT_tunnel_exit} (Right). If $n_1$ is occupied, then $n_2$ is free so that $n_5$ has to be bound $n_4$. Hence,  $a \geq 1$. This case can supply two binding capabilities but $p^\prime$ can bind to only one of $n_0$ or $n_2$ because $n_0$ or $n_2$ will be occupied by the successor of $p^\prime$. Therefore, this case $\#bc(C_{i}) - \#bc(C_{i-1}) \leq a$.
  
\end{itemize}

Thus,$\#bc(C_{i-2}) \geq \#bc(C_i)$ , and hence, $\#bc(C_{h-1}) \geq \#bc(C_i)$.
If $h < i-1$, then the second inequality is strengthened as $\#bc(C_{h-1}) > \#bc(C_{i})$ because $S[h] = b$, that is, $\#bc(C_{h-1}) > \#bc(C_h)$ and $\#bc(C_{h}) \geq \#bc(C_i)$. \qed

%Let $\Xi$ be a deterministic unary oritatami system of delay $\delta = 1$, arity $\alpha = 2$. We assume $S[h..i+1] = bt^{(i-h)}b \quad (1<h<i)$. If at least one of $w[h+1..i]$ is stabilized by tunnel $C$, then $\#bc(C_{h-3}) > \#bc(C_{h+1})$ and $\#bc(C_{h-3}) > \#bc(C_i)$.
%\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}[Lemma~ \ref{TTT_tunnelC_lemma}]
Let $\Xi$ be a unary oritatami system at $\delta = 1, \alpha = 2$.
Assume $S[h..i+1] = bt^{i-h}b (h<i)$. If at least one of $w[h+1..i]$ are stabilized by tunnel $C$, then only $w[h+1]$ can use tunnel $C$ because if $w[g]$ which is one of $w[h+2..i]$, with $h+2 \leq g \leq i$ is stabilized by tunnel $C$, $C_g$ is a terminal.


Let us consider stabilization $S[h-1..h+1] = tbt$ or $S[h-1..h+1] = bbt$ as follows. In result, $\#bc(C_{h-3}) > \#bc(C_{h+1})$. In addition according to Lemma~\ref{TTT_exit} $\#bc(C_{h+1}) \geq \#bc(C_{i})$. Thus, $\#bc(C_{h-3}) > \#bc(C_{h+1})$ and $\#bc(C_{h-3}) > \#bc(C_{i})$.
\\

\subsubsection{Case of $S[h-1..h+1] = bbt$}
See Fig.~\ref{TTT_tunnelC_enter_usingBond}.
If $w[h-1]$ forms one bond, then it leaves one free bond, but it is consumed by $w[h+1]$.
In addition, $w[h]$ has to bound.
Thus, in this cases, binding capability decreases by 1.
If $w[h-1]$ forms two bonds, then it does not leave any bond.
In addition, $w[h]$ has to be bound.
Thus, in this case, even if $w[h+1]$ supplies two free bonds, binding capability decreases by 1.

\subsubsection{Case of $S[h-1..h+1] = tbt_a$}
Fig.\ref{TTT_tunnelC_enter_usingTunnel} exhibits all the two kinds of stabilization depending on structures of tunnel C.

%\item{Left of Fig.\ref{TTT_tunnelC_enter_usingTunnel}}\\
  In this figure, Bead $n_4$ has at least one binding so that $w[h-1]$ has to bound $n_4$. Moreover, $w[h]$ has to bind to one of $n_1, n_2, n_3$ in order to stabilize deterministically. On the other hand, $w[h+1]$ can supply two bindings but has only two free neighbors. One of them is occupied by a successor. Therefore $w[h+1]$ can only bind one of $n_5, n_6$, that is, $w[h+1]$ supplies at most one binding. Thus, this case $\#bc(C_{h-1}) > \#bc(C_{h+1})$.

  These cases are divided on number of capabilities that $w[h-1]$ consumes.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[-]{$w[h-1]$ does not consume any bindings}\\
  According to Lemma~\ref{TTT_exit}, $\#bc(C_{h-3}) \geq \#bc(C_{h-1})$ because of $S[h-1] = t$.
    $w[h]$ has to bound one of $n_1, n_2, n_3$ in order to stabilize deterministically so that  $\#bc(C_{h-1}) > \#bc(C_{h})$.
    $w[h+1]$ has to be bound to $w[h-1]$ because $w[h-1]$ has bindings, that is, $w[h+1]$ consumes at least one hand and supplies at most one hand so that $\#bc(C_{h}) \geq \#bc(C_{h+1})$. Thus, in this cases $\#bc(C_{h-3}) > \#bc(C_{h+1})$.
%     This time, let us consider either $n_4$ is occupied or not. If $n_4$ is occupied, then $w[h-1]$ has no active bindings that is this situation consumes some binding capabilities. If $n_4$ is free and $w[h+2]$ is stabilized in $n_4$, then $w[h-1]$ has to bind $w[h+2]$. Therefore, In this case, stabilization of $w[h-1..h+2]$ consumes some bindings. If $n_4$ is free and $w[h+2]$ is stabilized except $n_4$, then this oritatami system has to use two binding capabilities in order to bind $w[h+2]$. Therefore, in this case consumes some bindings. Thus in this cases $\#bc(C_{h-1}) > \#bc(C_{h+2})$.

  \item[-]{$w[h-1]$ consumes one binding}\\
    In this case, $w_{h}$ has to be bound one of $n_1, n_2, n_3$. In addition, $w[h-1]$ and $w[h+1]$ are not supply any bindings. Thus, in this cases consume some binding capabilities.
  \item[-]{$w[h-1]$ consumes two bindings}\\
    In this case, $w[h-1]$ already consumes two binding. $w[h]$ has to be bound. $w[h+1]$ supplies two bindings. Thus, in this cases $\#bc(C_{h-1}) > \#bc(C_{h+1})$.

\proof%{Proof of Tunnel Troll Theorem}
Each bead in the transcript is bound either inside a tunnel or outside. If a bead is stabilized inside a tunnel, 
then it has at most one free neighbor, and hence its successor it to be stabilized there.
Moreover, if a bead is stabilized outside a tunnel, then its position is either an entrance of a tunnel or not.

Tunnel sections have three possible shapes up to symmetry : straight($S$), obtuse($O$) and acute($A$) turn (Fig. \ref{TTT_tunnel}), and we will consider each of those. 

%\begin{lemma}
%\label{TTT_neighbor_lemma}
%For unary transcripts at $\delta = 1$, if a bead has no free hand, then at least $\alpha + 2$ of its neighbors have to be occpied.
%\end{lemma}

Let us first consider cases of $\delta \geq 3, \alpha = 1$. 
See Fig.~\ref{TTT_tunnel_exit}. Consider the stabilization of $w[i]$. 
This bead $w[i]$, once stabilized, shares two neighbors with its predecessor $w[i-1]$, which are denoted by $n_3, n_4$. 
Both of them have been already occupied because $S[i] = t$. 

Since $S[i+1] \neq \blacksquare$, at least one of the other three neighbors, denoted by $n_0, n_1, n_2$, must be free. 
Assume that in the neighborhood of $w[i]$, there are two beads with one free neighbor even after $w[i]$ is stabilized. 
Before the stabilization of $w[i]$, such a bead had two free neighbors, and hence, is provided with at least one free bond. 
Thus, $w[i]$ is to be bonded to these two beads, and it decreases the binding capability by at least 1. 
It now suffices to check that this assumption holds no matter how $n_0, n_1, n_2$ are occupied as long as at least one of them is left free. 

Next, we consider the case of $\delta = 2, \alpha = 1$. We assume there is an index $h$ such that $S[h-1..h+1] = bbt$ or $S[h-1..h+1] = tbt$. According to Lemma~\ref{TTT_entrance_Tab}, if $w[h+1]$ is stabilized by tunnel $A$ or $B$, then $\#bc(C_{h-1}) > \#bc(C_{h})$. Also,  According to Lemma~\ref{TTT_tunnelC_lemma}, if $w[h+1]$ is stabilized by tunnel $C$, then $\#bc(C_{h-3}) > \#bc(C_{h+1})$.
On the other hand, if $S[k..l] = bt^{l-k}b$, then $\#bc(C_{k-1}) \geq \#bc(C_{l})$ because of Lemma~\ref{TTT_exit}. Therefore, if there are indices $i$ and $j$ such that $S[i..j+1] = bbt^{(j-i-1)}b$ or $S[i..j+1] = bt^mbt^nb \quad (m + n = j-i-1)$, then $\#bc(C_{i-1}) > \#bc(C_{j})$.

%\begin{lemma}
%\label{TTT_a4_2b_lemma}
%Let $\Xi$ be a deterministic unary oritatami system of $\delta = 1, \alpha = 4$.
%When a bead is stabilized by bond, it forms at least two bonds.
%\end{lemma}
%
%\begin{proof}%[proof of lemma]
%Suppose $w[i]$ were stabilized by only one bond. See Fig.~\ref{TTT_a4_lemma_fig}. If $n_3$ is free, $w[i-2]$ still has some bonds because of arity $\alpha = 4$. Thus, $n_4$ must be occupied; otherwise, $w[i]$ would be stabilized nondeterministically at $n_3$ and $n_4$. Moreover, also $n_2$ has to be occupied for deterministic and also $n_0, n_1$. $n_1$ has some hands because $n_3$ is free. Therefore, $w[i]$ is stabilized at $n_3$ and it has to use at least two hands. It contradict assumption.
%\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}[$\delta = 1, \alpha = 4$]
Let $\Xi$ be a deterministic unary oritatami system of $\delta = 1, \alpha = 4$. It can yield only finite conformation of length is $3n^2  + 3n + 1$.
\end{theorem}





\begin{proof}
%According to lemma\ref{TTT_a4_2b_lemma}, when $w[i]$ is stabilized, it has to use at least two bonds. Let us consider when a bead $w[i]$ which is the first bead out of $\hexagon_{w[-n+1]}^n$ is stabilized. See Fig.\ref{TTT_a4_first}. any $n_0, n_1, n_3, n_5$ is free because if some of them is occupied, $w[i]$ is not the first bead out of $\hexagon_{w[-n+1]}^n$. At least two neighbors of $w[i]$ except predecessor have to be occupied in order to bind. In this case, a point which is able to put a bead is only $n_2$. Therefore, any transcript cannot be stabilized in out of $\hexagon_{w[-n+1]}^n$. Hence oritatami system can yield only a finite structure whose size is $O(n^2)$ in $\delta =1, \alpha = 4$.

\begin{theorem}[$\delta = 1, \alpha = 3$]
Let $\Xi$ be a deterministic unary oritatami system of $\delta = 1, \alpha = 3$. It can yield only finite conformations of length is $O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

%Both $n_3$ and $n_4$ are occupied because $S[i] = t$ or $t^\times$.
%Suppose $w[i]$ were stabilized without any bond.
%Then, all neighbors of $n_3$ must be occupied as long as the bead at $n_3$ is not singular; otherwise, a bead at $n_3$ would be capable of forming a bond with $w[i]$.
%That is, $n_1$ is occupied.
%We can continue this argument in clockwise manner to fill the neighbors of $w[i]$ until a singular bead is encountered, if any.
%If needed, the same argument is applied starting from $n_4$ in counter-clockwise manner.
%Thus, all neighbors of $w[i]$ must be occupied but then $S[i+1] = \blacksquare$, contradiction. \qed


\begin{proof}
We consider cases which $w[i-1]$ is two distances away from the singular point.
Let us show that $\#bc(C_{i-1}) > \#bc(C_i)$, that is, when $w[i]$ is stabilized, $w[i]$ uses at least two hands.
Fig.\ref{TTT_a3_w} exhibits all the three kinds of possibility of stabilized $w[i]$.
Suppose $w[i]$ were able to be stabilized with using one hand in each cases.

% Then, $w[i]$ can be also stabilized at $n_3$. 

\begin{paragraph}{Case of straight}
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Case of $n_3$ is free\\
The bead $w[i-2]$ must not have bonds because $w[i]$ is stabilized deterministically so that five neighbors of $w[i-2]$ must be occupied.
Therefore $n_5$ must be occupied.
We can continue this argument in clockwise manner to fill the neighbors of $n_3$ until $n_1$.
However, two neighbors of $n_1$ must be free because they are $n_3$ and the point of $w[i]$, contradict.

\item[-] Otherwise\\
Both $n_3$ and $n_4$ are occupied.
One of $n_1$ and $n_2$ must be free because $S[i] = b$.
We assume $n_1$ is free, then all neighbors of $n_1$ must be occupied because $n_3$ is occupied.
However, one of neighbors $n_1$ is a point which $w[i]$ is stabilized, contradict.
\end{itemize}

Therefore, this case contradict assumption.
\end{paragraph}

\begin{paragraph}{Case of obtuse}
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Case of $n_3$ is free\\
Any neighbors of $n_3$ have to be occupied but the point which $w[i]$ is stabilized is free. Thus $n_3$ has to be occupied.
\item[-] Case of $n_4$ is free\\
The point $n_2$ must be occupied because $n_4$ is free and $n_5$ must be occupied.
Therefore $n_0$ is occupied.
The bead $w[i]$ forms just one bond so that one of $n_0, n_3$ leave some hands or both of them do not leave any bonds.\\
If $n_0$ has some hands, then $n_3$ does not have any hands so that $n_{-3}$ is occupied. 
We can continue this argument in clockwise manner to fill the neighbors of $w[i]$.
That is, $S[i] = \blacksquare$, contradict.

If $n_3$ has some hands, then $n_0$ does not have any hands so that neighbors of $w[i]$ are occupied. In the same previous way, contradict.\\
If both of $n_0, n_3$ do not have any hands, then both of $n_{-1}, n_{-3}$ are occupied. If one of $n_{-1}, n_{-3}$ has some hands, the other does not have any hands so that $n_{-2}$ is occupied. If both of $n_{-1}, n_{-3}$ do not have any hands, $n_{-2}$ has to be occupied and $n_{-2}$ has some hands, contradict.
\item[-] Case of $n_2$ is free\\
Any neighbors of $n_2$ have to be occupied so that $n_0$ is occupied. Any neighbors of $n_0$ except $n_2$ have to be also occupied but the point which is stabilized $w[i]$ is free. Thus $n_2$ has to be occupied.
\item[-] Case of $n_0$ is free\\
Any neighbors of $n_0$ have to be occupied so that $n_{-1}$ is occupied. Any neighbors of $n_{-1}$ except $n_0$ have to be also occupied but the point which is stabilized $w[i]$ is free. Thus $n_0$ has to be occupied. 
\end{itemize}
\end{paragraph}



\begin{paragraph}{Case of acute}
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Case of $n_4$ is free\\
The point $n_4$ and a point which is stabilized $w[i]$ are free so that  $w[i-2]$ has some bonds.
However, $w[i]$ can be also stabilized $n_4$ in this case. Thus, $n_4$ has to be occupied.
\item[-] Case of $n_2$ is free\\
The point $n_0$ has to be occupied. The point $n_1$ has to be also occupied because five neighbors of $n_0$ must be occupied.
We consider this case just like case of obtuse and that $n_4$ is free. Then if $w[i-2]$ binds $w[i]$, any $n_{-1}, n_{-2}, n_{-3}$ are occupied. If $n_1$ binds $w[i]$, this case is same. Also if $n_1$ and $w[i-2]$ do not have any hand, any $n_{-1}, n_{-2}, n_{-3}$ are occupied. Therefore, $w[i+1]$ cannot be provided.
\item[-] Case of $n_0$ is free\\
Any neighbors of $n_0$ have to be occupied so that $n_{1}$ is occupied. Any neighbors of $n_{1}$ except $n_0$ have to be also occupied but the point which is stabilized $w[i]$ is free. Thus $n_0$ has to be occupied. 
\item[-] Case of $n_1$ is free\\
Any neighbors of $n_1$ have to be occupied so that $n_{-1}$ is occupied. Any neighbors of $n_{-1}$ except $n_1$ have to be also occupied but the point which is stabilized $w[i]$ is free. Thus $n_1$ has to be occupied. 
\end{itemize}

Therefore, any situations contradict $S[i] = b$.
\end{paragraph}\\


Hence, $w[i]$ uses at least two bonds if $w[i-1]$ is at least two distances away the singular point.
The size of $ \hexagon^2_0 = 19$ and this number contain the singular point, its successor and its three neighbors which is it binds to. Therefore 14 times  $w[i]$ can be stabilized by forming one bond.
Therefore, a deterministic unary oritatami system at $\delta = 1$ and $\alpha = 3$ can yield only finite conformation of length is $2n + 14$.
\end{proof}




\begin{theorem}[$\delta= 1, \alpha=2$]
Let $\Xi$ be a unary oritatami system of $\delta = 1, \alpha = 2$. It can yield infinite structures but they are only zig-zag conformation.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By Tunnel Troll Theorem, any tunnel sections which represented in $bbt^+$ or $bt^+bt^+$ consume binding capabilities. If the sequence $S$ is free from any subsequence of the form $bt^+bt^+$, then it can factorize as $S = u_1 u_2 u_3 \cdots$ for some $u_1 , u_2 , u_3 , \cdots \in \{b\} \cup bbt^+$. Assume the length of $\sigma$ is $n$, seed supplies at most $2n$ binding capabilities. Therefore formula \ref{TTT_only_bond} hold.

\begin{eqnarray}
  \exists i \in \mathbb{N} \quad s.t. \quad u_{i-1} , u_i , u_{i+1} , u_{i+2} , \cdots \in \{ b \}
  \label{TTT_only_bond}
\end{eqnarray}


Let us represent $S$ as $S[i.i+1...] = v_i v_{i+1} v_{i+2} \cdots$ for some $v_i, v_{i+1}, v_{i+2}, \cdots \in \{ a, o\}$ where if $v_k$ is $a$, then $v_{k+1}$ is bound to $v_{k-1}$, if $v_k$ is $o$, then $v_{k+1}$ is NOT bound to $v_{k-1}$.


Let us consider the case of $v_k$ is $o$. See Fig.\ref{TTT_case_of_o}. $w[i-1]$ consumes some binding capabilities because $v_{i-1}$ is $b$. If the number of $w[i-1]$'s bindings is one binding, then $w[i+1]$ has to be bound except $n_1$ or $n_2$ so that $w[i+1]$ must consumes two bindings except the case of $n_1$ and $n_2$ are occupied and $w[i]$ consumes at least one binding. If $n_1$ and $n_2$ are occupied, then $w[i-1]$'s bindings are inactive, that is, $w[i-1]$ consumes two binding capabilities. Therefore, this case consumes binding capabilities. If $w[i-1]$ dose Not have any bindings, then $w[i-1]$ already consumes two bindings. In addition, $w[i]$ and $w[i+1]$ consume at least one binding. Therefore this case consumes binding capabilities. Thus, the formula \ref{TTT_only_a} hold and according to the formula \ref{TTT_only_bond} and the formula \ref{TTT_only_a}, the formula \ref{TTT_structure} is hold. Thus, in this case, oritatami system can yield infinite structures but they are only zig-zag conformation.

\end{proof}

\begin{eqnarray}
  \exists j \in \mathbb{N} \quad s.t. \quad u_j , u_{j+1} , u_{j+2} , \cdots \in \{ a \}
  \label{TTT_only_a}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
  | S | > \forall m \in \mathbb{N} \quad \to \quad \exists n \in \mathbb{N} \quad s.t. \quad S[n], S[n+1], \cdots \in \{ a \}
  \label{TTT_structure}
