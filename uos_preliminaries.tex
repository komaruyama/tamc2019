Let $\Sigma$ be a set of types of abstract molecules, or \textit{beads}. 
A bead of type $a \in \Sigma$ is called an $a$-bead. 
By $\Sigma^*$ and $\Sigma^\omega$, we denote the set of finite sequences of beads and that of one-way infinite sequences of beads, respectively. 
The empty sequence is denoted by $\lambda$. 
Let $w = b_1 b_2 \cdots b_n \in \Sigma^*$ be a sequence of length $n$ for some integer $n$ and bead types $b_1, \ldots, b_n \in \Sigma$. 
The \textit{length} of $w$ is denoted by $|w|$, that is, $|w| = n$. 
For two indices $i, j$ with $1 \le i \le j \le n$, we let $w[i..j]$ refer to the subsequence $b_i b_{i+1} \cdots b_{j-1}b_j$; if $i = j$, then $w[i..i]$ is simplified as $w[i]$. 
For $k \ge 1$, $w[1..k]$ is called a \textit{prefix} of $w$. 

Oritatami systems folds their transcript, which is a sequence of beads, over the triangular grid graph $\mathbb{T} = (V, E)$ cotranscriptionally. 
We designate one point in $V$ as the origin $O$ of $\mathbb{T}$. 
A directed path $P = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n$ in $\mathbb{T}$ is a sequence of \textit{pairwise-distinct} points $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \in V$ such that $\{p_i, p_{i+1}\} \in E$ for all $1 \le i < n$. 
Its $i$-th point is referred to as $P[i]$. 
Now we are ready to abstract RNA single-stranded structures in the name of conformation. 
A \textit{conformation} $C$ (over $\Sigma$) is a triple $(P, w, H)$ of a directed path $P$ in $\mathbb{T}$, $w \in \Sigma^*$ of the same length as $P$, and a set of h-interactions $H \subseteq \bigl\{\{i, j\} \bigm| 1 \le i, i+2 \le j, \{P[i], P[j]\} \in E \bigr\}$. 
This is to be interpreted as the sequence $w$ being folded along the path $P$ in such a manner that its $i$-th bead $w[i]$ is placed at the $i$-th point $P[i]$ and the $i$-th and $j$-th beads are bound (by a hydrogen-bond-based interaction) if and only if $\{i, j\} \in H$. 
The condition $i+2 \le j$ represents the topological restriction that two consecutive beads along the path cannot be bound. 
A \textit{rule set} $R \subseteq \Sigma \times \Sigma$ is a symmetric relation over $\Sigma$, that is, for all bead types $a, b \in \Sigma$, $(a, b) \in R$ implies $(b, a) \in R$. 
A bond $\{i, j\} \in H$ is \textit{valid with respect to $R$}, or simply $R$-valid, if $(w[i], w[j]) \in R$. 
This conformation $C$ is \textit{$R$-valid} if all of its bonds are $R$-valid. 
For an integer $\alpha \ge 1$, $C$ is \textit{of arity $\alpha$} if it contains a bead that forms $\alpha$ bonds but none of its bead forms more. 
By $\mathcal{C}_{\le \alpha}$, we denote the set of all conformations of arity at most $\alpha$. 

The oritatami system grows conformations by an operation called elongation. 
Given a rule set $R$ and an $R$-valid conformation $C_1 = (P, w, H)$, we say that another conformation $C_2$ is an elongation of $C_1$ by a bead $b \in \Sigma$, written as $C_1 \xrightarrow{R}_b C_2$, if $C_2 = (P p, wb, H \cup H')$ for some point $p \in V$ not along the path $P$ and set $H' \subseteq \bigl\{ \{i, |w|+1\} \bigm| 1 \le i < |w|, \{P[i], p\} \in E, (w[i], b) \in R \bigr\}$ of bonds formed by the $b$-bead; this set $H'$ can be empty. 
Note that $C_2$ is also $R$-valid. 
This operation is recursively extended to the elongation by a finite sequence of beads as: for any conformation $C$, $C \xrightarrow{R}_\lambda^* C$; and for a finite sequence of beads $w \in \Sigma^*$ and a bead $b \in \Sigma$, a conformation $C_1$ is elongated to a conformation $C_2$ by $wb$, written as $C_1 \xrightarrow{R}_{wb}^* C_2$, if there is a conformation $C'$ that satisfies $C_1 \xrightarrow{R}_w^* C'$ and $C' \xrightarrow{R}_b C_2$. 

An \textit{oritatami system} (OS) is a 6-tuple $\Xi = (\Sigma, R, \alpha, \delta, \sigma, w)$, where $\Sigma$ is a set of bead types, $R\subseteq \Sigma \times \Sigma$ is a rule set, $\alpha$ is an arity, $\delta \ge 1$ is a parameter called the \textit{delay}, $\sigma$ is an initial $R$-valid conformation of arity at most $\alpha$ over $\Sigma$ called the \textit{seed}, upon which its finite \textit{transcript} $w \in \Sigma^*$ is to be folded by stabilizing beads of $w$ one at a time so as to minimize energy collaboratively with the succeeding $\delta{-}1$ nascent beads. 
The energy of a conformation $C = (P, w, H)$, denoted by $\Delta G(C)$, is defined to be ${-}|H|$; the more bonds a conformation has, the more stable it gets. 
The set $\mathcal{F}(\Xi)$ of conformations \textit{foldable} by the system $\Xi$ is recursively defined as: the seed $\sigma$ is in $\mathcal{F}(\Xi)$; and provided that an elongation $C_i$ of $\sigma$ by the prefix $w[1..i]$ be foldable (i.e., $C_0 = \sigma$), its further elongation $C_{i+1}$ by the next bead $w[i+1]$ is foldable if 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:OS_CF}
C_{i+1} \in \argmin_{
\substack{
C \in \mathcal{C}_{\le \alpha} s.t. \\
C_i \xrightarrow{R}_{w[i+1]}C \\
}
}
\min \Bigl\{ \Delta G(C') \Bigm|
C \xrightarrow{R}^*_{w[i+2...i+k]}C', k\le \delta, C' \in \mathcal{C}_{\le \alpha}
\Bigr\}.
\end{equation}
%
Then we say that the bead $w[i+1]$ and the bonds it forms are \textit{stabilized} according to $C_{i+1}$. 
Note that an arity-$\alpha$ oritatami system cannot fold any conformation of arity larger than $\alpha$. 
A conformation foldable by $\Xi$ is \textit{terminal} if none of its elongations is foldable by $\Xi$. 
The OS $\Xi$ is \textit{deterministic} if for all $i \ge 0$, there exists at most one $C_{i+1}$ that satisfies \eqref{eq:OS_CF}. 
A deterministic oritatami system folds into a unique terminal conformation. 

In this paper, we mainly consider the unary oritatami system. 
An oritatami system is \textit{unary} if its bead type set $\Sigma$ is of size 1. 
Its sole element is denoted by $a$, that is, $\Sigma = \{a\}$. 
Its only possible rule is $(a, a)$ and without that, the system would not fold into anything meaningful but just into any elongation of its seed nondeterministically.
